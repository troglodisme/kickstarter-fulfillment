# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Shopify credentials

# Start server
npm start
```

### Environment Configuration
Create `.env` file with your Shopify credentials:
```bash
SHOPIFY_SHOP=your-shop-name
SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN=shpat_your_access_token
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Required Shopify Permissions

- `write_discounts` - Generate discount codes  
- `write_price_rules` - Create price rules
- `read_products` - Load store products for frontend

## 🎯 System Overview

This system automates the Kickstarter fulfillment workflow:

1. **CSV Processing** → Reads Kickstarter export data
2. **Smart Product Mapping** → Maps pledge items to Shopify product variants
3. **Customer Creation** → Creates/updates Shopify customer accounts
4. **Discount Generation** → Creates personalized discount codes
5. **Landing Page Creation** → Generates unique URLs for each backer
6. **Integrated Checkout** → Single-page experience for pledged + extra items

## 🧪 Testing with Sample Data

The system includes sample data for immediate testing:

```bash
# Start the server
npm start

# Test the sample customer (Frederik)
# Visit: http://localhost:3000/fulfillment/MTQzODM5NzMzNV9LUzFfNTgzNDMy

# Check API response
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/customer/MTQzODM5NzMzNV9LUzFfNTgzNDMy" | jq .

# View system status
curl http://localhost:3000
```

### Sample Customer Details
- **Name**: Frederik stott
- **Pledge**: £253.00
- **Items**: Ambient One (Black) £159 + Charging Dock + Sensor £72 + Accessories £22
- **Total**: £253 (perfectly balanced - customer pays £0)
- **Discount Code**: Auto-generated (e.g., KS1_583432)

## 📋 Production Usage

### 1. Process Your Own Kickstarter Data

```bash
# Start the server
npm start

# Process your CSV file
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/process" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"csvPath": "./data/your-kickstarter-export.csv"}'

# Monitor processing
curl http://localhost:3000/results
```

### 2. Kickstarter CSV Format
Your CSV export should include these columns:
- `Backer Name`, `Email`, `Pledge Amount`
- Product columns like `[Addon: XXXXX] product name`
- Count columns like `productname Count`

### 3. Product Mapping
The system uses smart mapping rules:
- `ambientone + blackanodising` → Ambient One (Black) £159
- `chargingdock + SFA30formaldehydesensor` → Charging Dock + Sensor £72
- `accessoriespack` → Accessories Pack £22

### 4. Generated URLs
Each customer gets a unique URL like:
```
http://localhost:3000/fulfillment/{BASE64_TOKEN}
```

### 5. Results Export
Processing creates CSV files in `./results/` with:
- Customer emails and names
- Generated discount codes
- Landing page URLs
- Cart links for Shopify checkout

## 🛒 Customer Experience

1. **Landing Page** → Shows pledged items + ability to add extras
2. **Smart Pricing** → Displays pledge credit vs item costs
3. **One-Click Checkout** → Direct to Shopify with discount applied
4. **Flexible Payment** → Pay only for extras beyond pledge value

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

- **Backend:** Node.js/Express server with Shopify Admin API integration
- **Frontend:** Responsive landing pages with dynamic product loading
- **Data:** CSV parser for Kickstarter exports with smart product mapping
- **Storage:** In-memory customer data with file-based result exports
